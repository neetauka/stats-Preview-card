## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](stats-preview-card-component-screeenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

i learnt how to place element together and how to change the display of element at different screen size. i also learnt how to add overlay to an image

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class=" border content">
        <div class="text">

          <h1>Get <span>insights</span> that help your business grow.</h1>
    
          <p id="middle">
            Discover the benefits of data analytics and make better decisions regarding revenue, customer experience, and overall efficiency.
          </p>
          <div class="heading">
            <h2>
              10k+<br><span>companies</span>
            </h2>
      
            <h2>
              314 <br><span>templates</span>
            </h2>
      
            <h2>
              12M+ <br><span> queries</span>
            </h2>
          </div>
        </div>
        
      </section>
```
```css
.content{
    background-color: var( --Dark-desaturated-blue);
    width: 420px;
    min-height:321px;
   
    border-bottom-left-radius: 8px;

## Acknowledgments

i want to thank the Holy spirit for his help in completing this project. when i started this project, i thought it wouldnt take time but unfortunately, i spent almost two weeks on this project. At a point, i wanted to give up but through God's encouragement, i mustered the courage to take it step by step and fix what is delaying me from completing the project. i'm glad that at last, we were able to finish it.
